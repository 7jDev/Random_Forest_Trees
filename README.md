# Random_Forest_Trees
I thought random forest trees were pretty neat so I built it from scratch in Python.

Trained a very small random forest tree(about 25 leaving out 25% of the dataset) on the titanic dataset getting a 71% accuracy. And, yes I could've made the accuracy wayyy better but 
(this is starting to be a theme in my GitHub) Either Python is too slow or the program I wrote is just slow(and I could guess it's probably the latter).
